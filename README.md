A web app to find movies playing in your area

Problem: There is no good place to see what movies are playing where and when. 

Fandango has no good way of checking what exactly is playing. It prioritizes theaters that use their ticketing. 

Atom tends to be better, but also struggles for theaters that donâ€™t use their ticketing.



First and foremost, there has to be a better was of seeing what is immediately playing.
